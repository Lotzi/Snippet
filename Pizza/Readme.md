## RIP API
Unfortunately, it seems that the API has been closed. This means that it can no longer be used. I deeply regret this. 
RIP Domino's API


## Error Handling
Actually, the package should create such an object address. Unfortunately this is not possible. The same applies to the customer. Unfortunately, the object cannot be created either. 

```Python 
def create_address(adr, city, state, plz):
    return Address(adr, city, state, plz)
```

This is a great pity, because these are an elementary part of.


```Python 
create_address(adr, city, state, plz)
create_customer(first_name, name, EMail, Number)
```

## Example
In the test file you can view a complete order once. Look here: [TestOrder.py](test.py).
But unfortunately, it is already clear that it will not work. 


## PIP Dependencies
Please install the PIP dependencies.

```PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
